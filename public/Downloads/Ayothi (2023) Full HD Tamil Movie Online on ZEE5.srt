00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.480
Give me ten more rupees.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.920
This is ten rupees.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.440
It isn't, give me 20 rupees,
brother.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.760
Keep your money with you.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.520
Get lost!

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.920
Move away from here.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.120
I'll hit you if you
keep on bargaining.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.640
"Glory to Shri Rama."

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.520
Protect our world.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.720
Hello, Balram.
- Hello, Ram Dutt.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.040
How are you? Is everything okay?
- Good. How are you?

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.240
Really?
- Then let's go.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.080
"Praise be to Lord Rama."
- "Glory to Lord Rama."

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.000
'Ayothi.'

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.880
"Praise be to Lord Rama."

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.920
"Praise be to Lord Rama."

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.960
"Praise be to Lord Rama."

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.040
"Praise be to Lord Rama."

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.040
"Praise be to Lord Rama."

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.040
"Praise be to Lord Rama."

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.040
"Praise be to Lord Rama."

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.880
"Praise be to Lord Rama."

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.040
"Praise be to Lord Rama."

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.040
"Praise be to Lord Rama."

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.040
"Praise be to Lord Rama."

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.080
"Praise be to Lord Rama."

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.040
"Praise be to Lord Rama."

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.880
"Praise Lord Rama."

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.880
"Praise be to Lord Rama."

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.080
"Praise Lord Rama."

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.040
"Praise be to Lord Rama."

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.040
"Praise Lord Rama."

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.080
"Praise be to Lord Rama."

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.760
"Praise Lord Rama."

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.520
"What a strange story
this is turning out to be."

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.080
"Who knows its prologue
and its epilogue?"

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.720
"Destination. Where does it go?"

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.800
"Neither he nor I know."

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.560
"What a weird story
this is turning out to be."

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.800
'Janaki.'
- Sister, come inside.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.280
'No, I'll wait.'
- Alright, I'll come.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.240
Mom?

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.240
Go and freshen up.
- First, give me money.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.880
Jai Shri Ram.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.480
"Oh, Divine Mother, our
hearts are filled with darkness."

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.320
"Please take this
darkness distant from us,"

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.680
"and promote
illumination within us."

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.520
"Oh, Divine Mother, our
hearts are filled with darkness."

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.400
"Please take this
darkness distant from us,"

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.000
"and promote
illumination within us."

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.520
"Oh, Divine Mother, our
hearts are filled with darkness."

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.520
"Please take this
darkness distant from us,"

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.120
"and promote
illumination within us."

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.360
What are you doing, son?

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.200
Homework.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.320
When did you get back
home from college?

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.960
I got back by 5 PM.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.120
We are going to Rameshwaram
next week on a pilgrimage.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.920
Pack two days earlier.
- Yes.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.720
The coffee is cold.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.880
Get me hot coffee.
- Okay.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.760
On 'Deepavali' day?

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.760
'Rameshwaram.'

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.920
The right person has to
teach you a lesson, isn't it?

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.240
How dare you rip the fishing net?

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.400
I'll rip your intestines
apart. Get lost!

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.200
Come, brother.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.440
'Ayothi.'

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.080
Mom?

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.960
Shivani.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.080
Which saree shall I
wear in Rameshwaram?

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.280
Your favourite colour,

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.160
'will be absolved.'

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.720
'Kavacha Theertham.'

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.160
'People who bathe in this
spring will not go to hell.'

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.520
'The spring is also located in
the Sethu Madhava temple.'

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.760
Janaki.
- The vibe...

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.200
Dad is ready.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.360
You get ready too, go.
- Hmm.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.920
Get ready soon.
- Mom,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.200
why leave now to
catch the 8 PM train?

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.040
Don't be annoyed,
your father will yell.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.400
I'm yelling like a dog,
can't you answer?

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.040
I'll be happier not
travelling with him.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:20.960
Janaki.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.880
Yes. Coming.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.080
Wait. I'm getting ready.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.800
Hurry up.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.800
You go, I'm not coming.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.800
If we bathe in the
Holy springs there,

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.000
He will become a
better person, dear.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:49.000
I feel it will be
beneficial for our family.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.080
Please tolerate him, for my sake.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.280
We are ready, we were
sorting out our clothes.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.600
I told you to get
ready two days earlier.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.400
Can't you do anything properly?

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.360
Let's go.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.880
Come.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.520
'Madurai.'

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.240
'Madurai Junction.'

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.040
'Madurai Railway
station welcomes you.'

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.960
(Railway announcement)

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.920
We must
reach Rameshwaram before sunrise.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:35.600
Okay.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.160
We'll be late if we go
by bus. Let's take a taxi.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.760
Hurry up.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.520
Come, Madam.
- I'll take you in my auto.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.680
I can take you real fast.
- Come, Ma'am.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.400
Meenakshi Amma temple?
- Want an auto?

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.120
Karuppu, why did you grab her bag?
- Get in, Ma'am.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.760
The fare is only fifty
rupees. Get into my auto.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.280
Don't be scared. Get in, ma'am.

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.000
I can take you
right into the temple.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.600
My boys are inside to take
you close to the sanctum.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:09.880
Hey!
- Let go.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:10.960
Moron!

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.800
Who is he? Did he snatch the bag?
- Are you mad?

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.800
I just took his bag. Why
are you getting so hyper?

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:15.840
Come.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.640
Who is he?
- He must be a lunatic.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.840
All of them are thieves.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.480
You should be careful.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.560
Understand?

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.280
Sit down. Wait here.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.680
I'll be back.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.320
Mom, how long is it to
Rameshwaram from here?

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.880
I don't know, dear. It
may take 1-2 hours.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.520
That long?

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.720
Let's go, I got a cab.
- Okay.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.120
Make it fast.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.520
Mom, I need to use the bathroom.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.120
Why didn't you go on the train?

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.520
It's festival time, you saw
the mad crowd in there.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.920
How could I?

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.280
Okay, wait.
- Open the boot.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.680
Get in.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.040
Listen, we'll be back in a bit.
- Why?

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.920
Shivani needs to use the toilet.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.240
Oh my God!

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.840
Do you know what your problem is?

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.880
You both don't know
where and how to behave.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.920
What bad timing.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.480
She's a teenager.
- Absolutely not.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Stop being a drama queen.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.760
I'm anxious about
reaching Rameshwaram,

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.320
before sunrise. End
of the discussion.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.560
Nothing wrong in
holding on for a while.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.360
Get into the taxi.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.720
Fine.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.440
Sir, belt. Wear your seat belt.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.800
Oh... Seat belt.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.720
Do you have an air conditioner?

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.840
AC... air conditioner You...

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.640
Wait, I'll switch it on.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.360
Speed only 70? At this pace,
we'll reach there by lunchtime.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.880
I don't understand. What?

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.520
Don't you understand Hindi?

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.880
Faster. Drive faster.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.480
Drive faster.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.360
What is your name?

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.160
Name.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.920
Kanagu.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.640
You! Hindi!

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.280
Why are you spitting inside my
car? Don't you have manners?

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.960
Take it and wipe that.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.680
Take it.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.120
Wipe it, man. Staring at me.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.360
Hey! Wipe it clean. He's
just doing it for the sake of it.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.960
I don't know which
side of the bed, I got up.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.040
Hey! What did you just say now?

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.160
What?
- What did you say?

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.520
What?
- You think I won't get it,

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.880
if you swear in Hindi?
- What?

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.760
Don't bug me. - I thought
that you were going to the temple

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.520
I'm warning you, don't argue -
with family, what are you speaking?

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.840
I'm sparing you because
you're my customer.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.680
Hey, shut your gob.
- What is it, you ***.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.960
Going on a pilgrimage, eh?
- Don't shout at me.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.280
God will run out of the temples.
- I'm telling you.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.680
Are these the words to
use in front of children.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.360
Stay within your limits.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.800
Since you got in the car.
- Please be calm.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.040
You are creating havoc.
- Don't talk to me like that.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.720
You deserve to be...

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.560
I'll hit you. Don't talk rubbish.
- What will you do?

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.560
What will you do, man?

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.120
Shut up.
- Don't just yell.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:11.680
Brother.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.200
I'm sparing you
because of the ladies.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.800
I would've made you get down.
- Look, I'm telling you.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.400
That's what I'll do.
What can you do?

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.040
Barbaric brute! Hey!
- I'll hit you.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.760
Brother, eyes on the road.
- Hey!

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.520
Hey, stop the car.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.040
Hello, Kanagu. Happy Deepavali.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.560
What are you saying?

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.160
Brother, give me sister's blouse.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.200
Have you got items for the function?
- Yes, sister.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.000
Did you collect my
blouse from the tailor?

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:20.680
Yes, sister.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.720
Check if it is stitched well.
- As if I can wear and see.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.520
These people. I'll be there.
- Did you start?

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.080
I'll be there in five minutes.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.480
We'll celebrate 'Deepavali'
in style, okay?

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.400
Come soon.
- Brother.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.840
Happy Deepavali.
- Come here.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.840
Come where? I have to attend
a ritual at sister's house.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.120
I must hand over Holy
water and the blouse to her.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:37.680
Get in the vehicle.

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.640
Sit.
- Where to?

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.960
Ah.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.120
Leave that wire bag behind.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.680
What are you saying?
Is our son crying?

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.280
My duty finishes by 8:00 pm.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.960
Tell him I'll buy
crackers on my way back.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.600
Ask him not to cry, dear.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.080
Collect your license tomorrow from
the station after the RTO enquiry.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.440
Okay?

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.080
What happened?

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.160
How?

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.280
Get down.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.520
Janaki?

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.120
Mom.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.080
Mom!
- Mom!

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.840
Mom?

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.840
What happened? Mom?

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.560
Mom, open your eyes.
- Mom!

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.680
Mom, look at me, wake up.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:07.040
Mom, get up.
- Mom!

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.720
Mom.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.840
Mom.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.280
Mom.
- Janaki.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.560
Mom!
- Janaki.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.640
Mom, get up.
- Mom!

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.120
Open your eyes, mom.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.680
Mom!
- Hey!

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.360
Mom, get up.
- Mom!

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.960
Mom!

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.360
Poor lady!

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.680
Mom?

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.800
Mom?
- Mom!

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.680
Mom!
- Mom!

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.240
Mom.
- Doctor.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.680
Check her, quick doctor.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.400
Look at me.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.760
Look at me.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.960
What is your name? Can you hear me?

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.040
Can you?

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.160
What is your name?

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.600
Madam? Look at your daughter.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.880
Mom, it's Shivani.
- Look at your son.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.720
Shivani.
- Open your eyes.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.200
Mom. Look at Sonu.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.520
You can hear us, right?
Can you hear me, mom?

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.360
Mom!
- Lift your hand.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.520
Raise your hand. Lift your hand.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.880
Mom!

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.040
Mom.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:03.880
Doctor.
- Okay.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.120
The patient is responding.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.800
Nurse, ask everyone to wait out.
- Doctor.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.000
Will my mother be fine?
- Let's go, sister.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.520
Please save her.
- Please wait outside.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.160
Please save my mother, doctor.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.360
That guy?

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.680
You...

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.680
You are the reason for all this.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.160
Who gave you a license?

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.280
Sir, wait. Hear me out.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:53.560
I won't spare you.
- Sir.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.840
I'll not spare you.
- Sir.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.720
We can talk it over, sir.
- Hey!

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.800
What do you think of yourself?
- Sir, listen to me.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.680
Kindly listen to me.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.240
We can discuss it, sir.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.360
I'll make sure you are dead.
- Hey.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.280
I'm telling you we can discuss it.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.520
I see.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.560
Have all you Tamilians ganged up?

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:13.880
Tamilian, huh! Vagabond!

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.440
You're at fault.
How dare you blame us?

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.840
What?
- Brother.

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.000
Come here.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.760
I'm not scared of anyone.
- Dad.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.200
Is mom alright?
- I'll push all of you behind bars.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.680
You tell.
- We don't have a neurosurgeon,

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.480
take her to the government Hospital
in Madurai, you can save her.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.960
What are you saying?
- Severe head injury.

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.240
Cerebral haemorrhage.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.480
Shift to Madurai Government Hospital
immediately, okay?

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.040
Ventilator ambulance
108 is not available.

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.720
Arrange for a private
ambulance quickly.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.400
Ambulance.
Ask him to do so, why should I?

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.920
He caused this accident.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.560
I can't say all that.
First, come and sign the report.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.720
Come in.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.920
Brother.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.480
Brother.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.560
Don't be annoyed with my father
That's his character.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.120
Kindly arrange for an ambulance.
Please.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.920
We are to blame Father for this.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.560
How is it my father's fault?

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.480
I don't know anyone here.
How will I arrange an ambulance?

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:21.760
My mother is very critical now.
I don't know what to do.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.440
Every second we delay,
her life is at risk.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:28.640
Please help us.
Arrange an ambulance, please.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.600
Sorry, brother, I'm sorry.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:37.040
It's our fault, right?
I'll apologise. I'm sorry.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.120
Please. Arrange an ambulance.

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.880
Please.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.560
Please help.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.800
Hey! Go and call the ambulance.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.160
Go, I say.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.600
Okay, take care of him.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.000
Hey.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.080
Thank you.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.960
Thank you.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.080
She will be fine, right?
- Hey, keep quiet.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.280
It's bad enough you've hurt your

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.360
hand with bursting crackers.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.520
She will be fine. I will take care.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.720
What happened?
- Brother.

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.000
Ramanathan

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.680
has a ventilator ambulance, brother.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.840
But the driver has
gone to the temple.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:06.920
What do I do now?

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.720
Is the ambulance ready?

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.120
Time is of the essence to save her.
- I'm coming, sir.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.240
Ask him to arrange it faster.
- Is there no other ambulance?

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.160
'I have enquired
in four different places.'

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.960
'I can't get a
ventilator ambulance.'

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.360
We have no other option, brother.'

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.720
'Shall I wait here
till the driver returns, Brother?'

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.680
We don't have time for all that
You drive the ambulance here.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.640
We can ask the driver
to come to the hospital.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.720
Sir, my duty gets
over in ten minutes.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:35.920
David will take over, sir.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.960
We don't have time
until he comes, go.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.120
Ask them to get in.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.400
What happened?

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.360
The driver promised to come
but isn't picking up my call now.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.240
What do we do now, Brother?

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.480
In one go,
we will drop them off in Madurai.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.880
In one go? I must give sister
this blouse in half an hour.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.800
Get in.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.680
Sir, can you wait for ten minutes?
- Why?

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.800
My duty is over. David will be here.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.760
Get inside.
- No sense of emergency.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.320
Get in.
- I have to go home, sir.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.640
Please wait, sir.
- Wait a minute, brother.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.120
We can be back in two hours.
- Sir, please, sir.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.080
Get in first, get in.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.320
Mom.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.280
Mom.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.160
I will be home soon.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.440
I'm telling you. I'll be home soon.

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.680
Okay, disconnect now.
Drive fast, man.

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.280
What?

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.720
My college fees have to be paid.

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.520
Two days later.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.200
Today is the last day.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.800
Did I ask you to go to college?

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.960
I'll pay when I can.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.840
"Oh, Divine Mother, our hearts
are filled with darkness."

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.600
Shivani.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.840
You forgot to take your lunch.
- Oh god, bless us.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.760
Shivani.
- Bless our souls.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:16.960
Shivani.

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.320
Oh god, bless us.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.680
What, mom?
- Tiffin box.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.560
If I don't eat one day, I won't die.

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:29.720
'Ganpati Bappa Morya.'

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.560
Pay your fees.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.360
Mom?

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:55.520
Mom?

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.520
Mom! Mom?

00:35:58.600 --> 00:35:59.880
Hey, man.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.040
Hey. Look at her.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.040
Move aside. Give way.
- Mom?

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.560
Mom?

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.320
Mom, what happened?
- Mom?

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.800
Janaki!
- You'll be fine, mom.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.800
Check fast,
what's happening, brother?

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.600
Quick.
- Mom.

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.840
Check what's going on. Check now.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:15.920
Janaki!
- Mom.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.480
Brother, drive fast.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.240
It looks like she is having fits.
Ask him to speed up.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.800
Mom, nothing will happen.
- She has got fits.

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.200
Please speed up.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.000
Nothing will happen, mom.

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.560
Mom?

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.080
Nothing will happen.
- Janaki.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.760
Check what's wrong, brother.
- Mom.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.880
Mom, you'll be fine.
- Mom?

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.320
Mom?
- Brother, quick.

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.840
Attend to her.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.320
What do I do?

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.960
Mom.

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.320
Mom?

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.080
Brother, drive faster.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.840
Attend to her, quick!
- Tell the driver to go fast.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:49.160
She is critical. Drive fast.
- Fast, please.

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.160
Mom.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:26.840
Nothing should happen to her.
Please do something.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.440
Mom?

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.800
Janaki.
- Mom?

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.120
What happened?
- What?

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.600
Sitting like that! Do something.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:54.920
Mom!

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.560
Mom!

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.320
Mom.

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.440
Mom.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.840
You'll be alright, mom.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.880
I'll not let anything happen
to you, mom. Get up, mom.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.560
Mom.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.600
Open your eyes, mom.
- Mom?

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.160
Look at us, mom.
- Janaki.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.080
You are okay, mom.
- Please look at her.

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:44.040
Get up, mom.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.160
Janaki.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.120
Janaki.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.160
Ja...

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.560
Do something.
- Mom?

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.200
Can't you hear me?

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:04.400
Why are you sitting quietly?
Out of your mind or what?

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.840
Look at her.
- Mom?

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.480
Janaki.

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.720
Mom!

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.240
Mom!

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.880
Mom.

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:31.080
Mom!

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.960
Mom!

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.400
Tell me.
- That lady passed away.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.760
Where are you now?
- Near ring road in Madurai.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.880
Drop her at Madurai
General Hospital.

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:12.080
Police will take care of the rest.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:13.920
Okay.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.600
Bro, you have to tell, right? - I'm
here only to do emergency first aid.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.360
I can't say if she's alive or dead.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.640
Hey, speak like a human.
- Only a doctor can.

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.120
Won't you declare her dead?

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.240
I can't pronounce her dead.
Only a doctor can certify.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.120
Try to understand.
- Hey, what's the problem?

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.040
I believe he cannot say
if she's alive or dead.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.600
Better to get it
confirmed by a doctor.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.040
Mad fellow!

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.600
What, sir?
- She's dead.

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:20.480
Take the body to GH.
- What?

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.960
Post mortem.
- Post mortem.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.160
No.

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.760
No post mortem.

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:26.960
Post-mortem is compulsory.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.080
Accidental death.
- You don't understand.

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.080
If I say no, it means 'no'.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.280
How do I explain?

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.560
How do I make them understand?

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.320
Brother, listen.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.560
We follow 'Dharma'.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.080
'Culture.'

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.360
Our religion doesn't allow it.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.880
Post mortem.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.920
If she dies.

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.720
After death.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.400
The last rite is on the pyre.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:58.160
Before that,
no cutting or any poking.

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.600
No.
- What is he saying?

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:03.800
Sir, he comes from a family which
follows righteousness strictly.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.200
He says post-mortem is not allowed.

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.640
If it is done, he says
he will be in a royal mess.

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.920
Where did you find him?
- What?

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.840
Brother.
- No, the postmortem...

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:18.960
Want to use the restroom?

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.520
Sir, is there any bathroom?
- Right there.

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.320
Try and convince him.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.400
Okay, sir, please come.

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.440
'We'll be back now.
- Why?'

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.440
'Shivani needs to use the toilet.'

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:34.560
'Nothing wrong in
holding on for a while.'

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.240
'Get into the taxi.'

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:54.240
'Mahant of Deshrath Gaddi, our Baba
Brij Mohan Das never remains sad.'

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:57.160
'Mahant of Deshrath gaddi...'

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.120
Hello, Ram Dutt.
- Hey Balram!

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.320
Had a good pilgrimage
in Rameshwaram?

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:05.400
Janaki passed away.
- Oh God! When?

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.400
Doctor is insisting
on a post-mortem.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:14.600
No post-mortem.
According to our religious beliefs,

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.080
the body, once dead
should not be cut open.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:20.880
Listen to me.
You bring Janaki here to Ayodhya.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.080
Ram Dutt, there are no
trains for three days.

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.840
Why do you have to bring her
in a train or a bus?

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:28.600
Airlift her.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.800
Do you have cash with you?
- I lost it all.

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.400
The bag, cash, and
clothes are all gone.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.880
Don't worry.

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:38.280
Go to the airport.
I'll send you the cash.

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.640
Thank you, Ram Dutt.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.960
You're doing unnecessary stuff.

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:47.440
We're in a rush, just like you.

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:48.680
Keep quiet.
- So...?

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.240
Will you get confirmation from all
the quack doctors on the roadside?

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.200
Why will we come here
knowing she's dead?

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.080
That is not my job.
I can only do first aid.

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.440
Only government doctors will follow
procedures and tell you factually.

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:00.160
Damn the procedure!
- Look here.

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:03.160
Drop us at the airport.
I'll handle the rest.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:05.680
What? To the airport?
I can't go to the airport.

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.920
I'll deliver the body at GH.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.920
After that, bloody well
follow their advice.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.440
Sir, watch your tongue.

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.840
Had this lady got
hurt ten minutes later,

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:15.640
I would've been home by this time.

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.160
Unnecessarily you are bugging me.

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:18.920
All my fate! Get into the van.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.160
You can go in ten minutes.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.440
Don't scream now. Get into the van.

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.200
Get in.

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.680
Wonder what more will happen!

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.680
Tough to handle this Hindi
man and mad chap. - Brother.

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:33.160
We don't know anyone here.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.560
I don't understand your language.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.800
If you would like to help us.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.240
Send us back home at the earliest.

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.640
Please.

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.800
What does she want?

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.880
I can't understand
what she is saying.

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:50.560
But I figure she's
asking us to help her.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.320
Hey! Go away.

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:06.880
Go burst the crackers over there.

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.720
Bursting crackers
near my brand-new bike!

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.600
Happy Diwali, dude.

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:20.200
Will they allow
a dead body on the flight?

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.280
Yes, they will.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.520
But some rules and
regulations are to be followed.

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.320
We must enquire only at the airport.

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.000
Any problem?

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:30.520
Nothing. I will call you later.

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:47.440
Hey, where are you going?

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:50.800
Why did you turn left?
You have to go straight for GH.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.760
Stop the vehicle.
- Why invite trouble?

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.320
Poor thing!
Let's drop them off at the airport.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.560
You.

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.280
Hey! Stop the vehicle.

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.800
Where are you happily
driving off to?

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:02.640
Hey, you are going as you wish.

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:03.640
We'll drop them off
and come back soon.

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.720
I insist you stop the vehicle.

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.000
How can we stop on a highway?
- I insist you stop the vehicle.

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.960
He might jump off
the vehicle, mad fellow.

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:10.640
Pull over on the kerb side.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.360
I swear, I will...

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.920
Hey, get off the vehicle.
Get down, I say.

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:22.920
Are you thinking that
you are driving a call taxi?

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.080
Turning as you wish
with a corpse inside!

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.160
The airport is very close to here.

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.960
If we buy them two tickets and
drop them at GH, they'll go home.

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.000
Some stranger died.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.240
Going overboard
as if it is your mother!

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.680
You've been nasty
from the beginning.

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.280
What is your problem?

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.960
Listen, an ambulance will go
to the airport first and then to GH.

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:42.360
Get in if you want.
Otherwise, leave.

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:15.040
Sir, a lady passed away
She has to be airlifted.

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.760
Then you must enquire about cargo.

00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:18.720
Where is it?
- Take a left.

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.720
Dude, you stay here.

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.640
Please come with me. Come.

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:48.800
To send dead bodies by flight
You should have a police FIR,

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.160
mortuary card, death report,

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:54.560
police clearance certificate,
embalming certificate,

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.960
sealing certificate,
undertaking certificate.

00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.320
Along with these, we need
ID card of the dead person.

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.880
Also, a person to go with the body.
This is our protocol, sir.

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.680
What is this, sir?
Your list is endless.

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.200
Air India flight leaves at 8:00 pm.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.240
If you arrive two hours
before departure,

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:11.800
we can send the body by that flight.

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:15.200
This is the last flight
to Lucknow for tonight.

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:17.640
If you don't make it, the next
flight is only after four days.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:18.520
The last flight?

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.880
How much will it cost? Total money?

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:24.040
Three tickets, cargo.

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:26.480
Approximately one lakh rupees.

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:31.360
How much?
- One lakh rupees.

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:34.640
One lakh rupees?
- Yes.

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.360
Don't buy the tickets first.

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.960
Arrange for the seven certificates
and then buy the tickets.

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.960
Sir, even changing the initials

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:44.840
in our ration cards
name will take one month.

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:47.560
And you are asking for
seven certificates in one day!

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:49.840
That too on a festival day.
How is it possible to get it?

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.080
What to do?
I have to follow our rules.

00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:56.600
Hello, what?
- How can it cost one lakh rupees?

00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.840
Where?
- Trying to fool us?

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:01.800
I'll be right there.
- How can it be one lakh rupees?

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.680
Brother, this is
government fixed-rate.

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:04.920
Where are you going?

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.880
Hey, at least talk
about the post-mortem.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.120
Why do they need
so many certificates?

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.800
Listen...

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:18.640
What is that bag in your hand?
- My sister's blouse.

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:21.480
Why are you here?
- I came to help them.

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:23.560
Pandi, what is happening?

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:26.280
You manhandled the white uniform
and he called the khaki uniform!

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:27.880
Hey, who are you?

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:30.320
Sir, I drove the ambulance.
- Are you an ambulance driver?

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:31.720
No, sir.
- Then?

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:33.160
How are you related to them?

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.000
Sir, they are tourists from Ayothi.

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.360
On the way to Rameshwaram...
- Get into the police jeep.

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:37.720
Get the ambulance, bring them.

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.440
Get them in.
- Why are you taking us, sir?

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.400
Get in the vehicle.
- What did we do, sir?

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.920
Get them all into the jeep.
- What mistake did we commit, sir?

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.440
Go.

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.560
Senthil, park the ambulance at GH
and come to the police station.

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.920
On a festival day
they give us a hard time!

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:09.280
This is for Inspector's
sister-in-law.

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.920
This too, sir?
- Yes.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.760
I have parked the vehicle in
government Hospital, here's the key.

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:20.160
(Voice in the walkie talkie)

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.360
Are you a troublemaker?

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.280
If you manhandle
a staff member on duty.

00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:32.840
As per Section #332, you get
imprisonment for three years.

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:34.600
Do you know?

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:38.200
Brother, do you know them?
- No, sir.

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:39.920
Why did you bring us here?

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.400
Look, my wife just died.

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.680
I have to leave immediately.
- Relax.

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.840
What is he saying?

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.120
Post-mortem is out of the question.

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:49.600
My wife...

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:52.360
My wife's body cannot be cut
or dissected by anyone.

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:53.800
Sir.
- No!

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.600
I won't allow post-mortem.

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:58.040
You are objecting to post-mortem.

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.240
Then did you kill her?

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.120
If you raise your voice

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:05.560
you'll bleed instead
of peeing if I hit you.

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.240
Brother, enquire
about them individually.

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:11.760
Check if their stories match.
- Okay, sir.

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.280
Come with me.

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.320
Brother, you come along too.

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:27.840
Will they visit Rameshwaram
even during the festival of lights?

00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.080
Lord Rama built that temple.

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:31.640
He is their family deity.

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:34.440
That temple is open to devotees
the whole year through.

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.280
Give sir that milk sweet.

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:39.440
What is that?

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:42.000
From which shop?
- Deepavali freebies, sir.

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:45.600
He gave us stale sweets!
- We can shut down his shop, sir.

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.440
First, do that.

00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:52.000
This chap seems so familiar.

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.600
He has robbed a drunken slob
lying on the road, sir.

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:56.000
Passers-by who saw called.

00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:57.400
Sir, once sober, he'll make

00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:00.200
a beeline to the
government liquor shop

00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.360
I kept it as a safety measure.

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.400
Bloody thief!
Heard that excuse, head constable?

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:05.800
He is going to call me.

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:09.160
Come here.
- I am in for it.

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:10.840
Hello, sir.
- Hey!

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:13.640
What are you up to?
- Sir, greetings.

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.560
You detained me for a day
and thrashed me in Tirunelveli.

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.240
Do you remember me?

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:25.720
Okay.

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:27.720
Did I jog his memory in haste?

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.600
That was a long time ago.
I don't steal now, sir.

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:34.680
Why is he shifting his posture?
I'll try to wriggle out of it.

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:36.920
This is just a matter of habit, sir.

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.400
Caught red-handed.

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:41.040
Hey! You sing, right?

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:43.880
Yes, sir. You're right, sir.

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:45.560
Shall I sing about my girl?

00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:47.480
Do you mean to say
you have a girlfriend?

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.360
Yes, sir.

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:54.560
I interrogated them, sir.

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:56.520
They are from the government
Hospital in Ramnad.

00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:58.240
He has the AR copy, sir.

00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:00.840
It is an accident case.
No other problem.

00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:02.640
If you file a first
information report,

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:04.320
I can take them
to the mortuary, sir.

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:07.240
What are you looking at?
You are the one to blame.

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:09.080
Sir, I'll take leave.

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:11.120
Hey! Where are you off to?

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.360
None of you can step out
without doing the post-mortem.

00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:15.480
Go and sit.
- What did I do, sir?

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:16.920
I just lent a helping hand.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.920
Is catching roadside travellers
your idea of help, eh?

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.960
Any accident is a police case.

00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:24.560
When you drove to the airport
instead of a government Hospital.

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.240
You committed a crime.

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.240
Why should I even talk to you?
- Sir.

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:30.240
I'll handle this, sir. Come with me.

00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:31.600
Come along, brother.

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.920
Whichever angle you view this,
you can't step out now.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.400
If you are a bit patient,

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:38.400
you can get the post-mortem report
from the mortuary, and go home.

00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.440
This isn't a place to fight.

00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:42.040
Who will help
if he behaves like this?

00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:43.560
Natural Instinct
will be to step back.

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:45.480
I understand, please sit.

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:49.280
If you don't sing properly,
I'll slap you on the cheek!

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:51.120
Okay, sir.

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.480
Sing now.

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.840
My glasses?

00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:12.560
"She stole the heart of a thief."

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:16.880
"She made an impact
on this dry heart of mine."

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:21.120
"She stole the heart of a thief."

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:26.120
"She made an impact
on this dry heart of mine."

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:30.080
"We shared milk
popsicles juicy near the pillars"

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:34.040
"and shared it
with certain intimacy."

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:38.120
"Her slightest glance of desire
will make cold water catch fire!"

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:42.880
"Even a red ant will
fall for her words."

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:47.120
"She asked for a gold chain as a
gift, I stole it with my expertise."

00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:51.040
"To give her a gold earring."

00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:56.080
"I saw ninety ears
before snatching it."

00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:00.400
"She stole the heart of a thief."

00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:04.680
"She made an impact
on this dry heart of mine."

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:09.440
"She stole the heart of a thief."

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:13.680
"She made an impact
on this dry heart of mine."

00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:31.040
"Pretty as our head
constable is she."

00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:35.280
"Just like you, her
father would glare at me."

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:39.680
"Her skin tone is like this stick."

00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:43.280
"If I make a mistake,
she will spear me with her eyes."

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:47.600
"I scattered into pieces explosively
when her pinky finger touched me."

00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:51.800
"When both her hands touched me
I forgot my existence truly."

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:56.120
"I have always stolen
and got away most often."

00:56:56.200 --> 00:57:00.600
"But in her heart alone
I got caught all of a sudden."

00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:04.680
"She blazed, shining bright
in my heart and mind with delight."

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:08.960
"Like a grain to the soil forged
into my soul and merged forever."

00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:13.240
"She stole the heart of a thief."

00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:17.560
"She made an impact
on this dry heart of mine."

00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:22.240
"She stole the heart of a thief."

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:26.400
"She made an impact
on this dry heart of mine."

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:30.720
"We shared milk
popsicles juicy near ten popsicles"

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:34.680
"and shared it
with certain intimacy."

00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:38.760
"Her slightest glance of desire
will make cold water catch fire!"

00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:43.480
"Even a red ant will
fall for her words."

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:45.840
"She asked for a
gold chain as a gift."

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:47.800
"With my expertise, I stole it."

00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:50.040
"She wanted gold
earrings as gift ."

00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:52.520
"I checked ninety ears
before I snatched it."

00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.280
Brother.

00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:25.400
When did you flick this?

00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.560
They don't know Tamil anyway.

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.880
Okay, anyway, the post-mortem report

00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:36.040
will certify it is
an accidental death.

00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:37.560
Despite it, if the cops nab us.

00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:38.640
We can cover up

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.560
asking him to forgive us, giving
Deepavali as a suitable excuse.

00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:43.640
Why invite more trouble?
We will leave in ten minutes.

00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:50.400
Balram.

00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:54.720
If you want to return safely,
hold your tongue in the mortuary.

00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:57.160
I won't agree to post-mortem.

00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:00.360
No post mortem, no Ayothi.
Understand?

00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:01.840
Get down.

00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:11.760
Come.

00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:13.840
Come.

00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:16.520
Come, sir.

00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:19.600
Hurry up.

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:30.320
What is this ruckus?
- Greetings, sir.

00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:32.760
Thirteen dead bodies today, sir.

00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:34.680
A 9-year-old kid committed suicide

00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:37.160
because his parents
didn't buy him crackers.

00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:39.440
I'll drink tea and be back.
- Okay.

00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:45.160
How could he kill himself for this?
- That's how our world is now.

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:19.840
It costs one lakh rupees
to airlift the body?

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.800
Cheaper to take her by road
in an ambulance.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.560
That will be even more expensive.

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.280
Cops will stop you at check posts

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.160
the entire three day
journey and hassle you.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.200
That's even more torture.

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:31.160
No freezer facilities on the train
and the body will decompose.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:34.320
So whoever dies here,
flight is the only option.

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.200
Damn!

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:38.400
Give me money for tea.
- I don't have any cash on me.

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.320
Don't be mean, head constable.
- Shut up!

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:41.880
Don't be a pain!

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.160
Here.
- Thank you, sir.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:49.120
We can show off as police outside.

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.040
We have to be friendly with them.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.920
Otherwise, they won't release
the dead body till evening.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.560
Who is he?
How stone-hearted can he be!

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:03.760
He hasn't shed a
single tear for his wife.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:07.000
Hey, Muruga brother.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:08.520
Hey, Muthu.

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.200
What? - Celebrating
Deepavali at the mortuary?

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.480
These cops will take care
of the rest. Let's go back home.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.920
Let's go, Brother.
- Wait, let me go and tell her.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.120
I'm leaving.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:42.240
Do you understand what I'm saying?
- I'm sure she will, let's go.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.400
Sonu?

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.040
Sonu?

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.280
Sonu?

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.440
Sonu?

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.800
Sonu?

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.320
Sonu?

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.720
Sonu?

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.560
Sonu?

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.640
Sonu!

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:03.400
Sonu?

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.440
So...

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.280
Sir?

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:45.640
No... no need.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:48.320
Do you wish to donate
your wife's eyes?

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:49.600
Wife?
- Yes.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.320
What 'wife'?
- Eye donation.

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:52.520
Eye...?
- Yes.

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:53.720
Eye donation?
- Yes.

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:55.160
My wife's eyes?
- Yes.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.280
Get away from here.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.240
What nonsense!
- Real madcap!

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:02.360
First, dissecting her body.
Now grabbing her eyes?

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:07.800
Do you have any saree
to drape around your mother?

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:10.960
Bring her saree.

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:12.960
Okay, sir.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.760
Poor thing! Not knowing
the local language.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.880
And losing her mother
is a cruel blow.

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.320
'Your favourite colour.'

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.040
I celebrated Deepavali
with you for the past four years.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.760
Even on a festival day,
a policeman gets only a cold meal!

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.160
Take it.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.760
Dissect Kumar.
This case is through us.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.720
Deal with it carefully.
- You've told me, right?

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.160
Check the body after I prepare it.

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:19.720
You'll think she's asleep.
- Okay, go.

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.080
Sit down, dear.

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:36.040
'Send us home at the earliest.'

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.120
'Please.'

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.480
'What does she want?'

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.120
'I can't understand
what she is saying.'

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.840
'But I figure she's
asking us to help her.'

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.440
'Who is he?
How stone-hearted can he be!'

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.560
'He hasn't shed a
single tear for his wife.'

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.480
Hey! Turn the ambulance.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.280
Reverse the vehicle.

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.440
Hey! Do as I say.

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:30.800
What happened, brother?

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:34.360
If we leave her halfway through
my mind will be guilt-ridden.

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.640
You leave if you want.
I'll stay and help them.

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.640
Bro, I said, 'Let us leave.'

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:43.040
I never said I would leave alone.
Come, let's try our best.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.240
Must take her to your city.
Do you have cash on you?

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.880
Money... money.
- No, accident.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.000
Lost.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:06.800
Will come in thirty minutes.

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:09.280
Your wife is dead. - Have you
arranged cash for the ticket?

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:13.040
Wait, he doesn't have money.
We have to arrange it.

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:20.280
That isn't real gold.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.280
That is just fake gold.

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:25.760
How much do you have?

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:28.400
Give it.

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:33.880
Take this cash. Buy the ticket.

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.400
I'll send you the balance cash, go.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:39.520
Do it.
- Durai, please speed it up. - Okay.

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:43.000
What is the next step, sir?
- Next is embalming.

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:44.840
Must get permission from the Dean.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:47.560
Today is Deepavali,
So she won't sign.

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:49.280
What do you do...

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:55.440
His name is Chitrapandian.

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.320
If he recommends,
the Dean will sign.

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:01.880
Token number one-Murali.

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:48.520
Sir, Deepavali.

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:57.600
Token number two-Janaki.

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:35.240
Give whatever you can.
It's Deepavali, a festival day.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.400
Got cash on you?

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.560
I gave you whatever I had.

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:54.480
Why do you ask now
when we are stressed.

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:28.200
Brother, here you are.

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.840
Go give it to counter number four.

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:47.240
Hey, out of seven certificates
required by the cargo officer,

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:50.120
we have got four ready.
- We have only four more hours left.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.720
We must get three more certificates,

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:55.000
arrange one lakh cash
and send them right away.

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.400
I'm asking you again.

01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.640
Do you have to take so much risk
and send them home?

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:07.040
At any point of time in your life
without anyone coming to your aid.

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:11.000
Have you stood all alone in front of
the pyre of your most loved one?

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:16.640
To get them out of this place
as fast as we can

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:18.720
is the biggest favour
we can do for them.

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:21.000
Is it even possible?
- Why not?

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.560
I believe if
Chitrapandian recommends

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:23.960
the Dean will sign immediately.

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:25.000
How about the money?

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:27.240
That man said people from
his town will send money.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.440
Listen, you take them
to the Dean's house.

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:31.800
I'll bring Chitrapandian, go.
- Okay.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:36.120
Dude, we have
eighteen thousand rupees

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:37.800
with the gold chain
and cash you gave.

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.600
But one ticket costs sixteen
thousand and five hundred rupees.

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:42.560
We can book one ticket for now.
Whose name should we book?

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.360
Whose name should it be?

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:46.160
Anyway, we can't book
in that man's name.

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.040
Both his children
will be stuck alone.

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:50.840
Can't book in minor son's name,
because he can't fly alone.

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.120
The only option is to get
a ticket for that girl.

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:55.080
Okay, book it in her name.

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:01.600
Dude, I booked one ticket.

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:02.920
We still have to buy two more.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.480
But only four tickets
are left on that flight.

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:07.040
We can book depending on
how fast you can arrange the cash.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.840
Do you have any money on you?

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:10.800
I already told you, dude.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.760
I spent what I had on the bike.

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:15.520
Okay, hang up.
- Quick, dude.

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:19.680
How much money can you spare?
- I thought of asking you!

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:22.040
Come and share a peg or two.
But don't ask me for cash.

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:23.800
He can't be trusted.

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.720
They have sent only
five thousand rupees.

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:26.880
The ball is in our court now.

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:30.240
I told you to drop them off.
- I know what I should do.

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.440
Just send the money.

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:40.440
This is the coffin box.

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.000
After a person dies, his body
will be sent by flight in this.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.920
There are different types of
coffin boxes based on each town.

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:47.400
How much will it cost?

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:49.160
Maybe around fifty thousand rupees.

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.680
I hope you have money!

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.720
Can I give you tomorrow?

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.360
Sending it tomorrow, so pay me then.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:57.800
Tomorrow?
We have to send them by tonight.

01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:59.920
The next flight is after four days.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.520
How is that possible?
Today is a holiday.

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:05.120
Sir, they are doing a post-mortem.

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:07.360
Post-mortem is done
365 days a year.

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:09.480
But embalming will not
be done on holiday!

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:12.360
It is the job of the Anatomy
department in medical college

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:13.680
to embalm the body.

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:16.120
Sir, I heard that if you recommend,
the Dean will sign the report.

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.080
It doesn't matter who recommends it,
she won't sign on a Deepavali day.

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:22.000
Can the body be sent
without embalming?

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:25.160
Without embalming,
airlift isn't allowed.

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:27.560
Sir, they have come
from North India.

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:29.320
They haven't even dipped
their feet in Rameshwaram.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.360
Try to do something, sir.
- What can we do?

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:33.000
I'll give you extra
money if you want.

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:36.160
This is my daughter's first
Deepavali after her wedding.

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.080
Still, didn't I come
just because you called?

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:40.880
Just not me, Dean won't sign today
under anyone's recommendation.

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.560
Those are the rules. Do you get it?
Please come tomorrow.

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:13.000
Bro, where is Chitrapandian?

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:15.840
Hello, brother.

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:17.960
I want to meet the Dean.

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.760
Do you have an appointment?
- No.

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:23.040
She isn't well, I've been instructed
not to allow any visitors.

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:26.640
Look there, very urgent.
At least find out from her.

01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:29.080
If I go in unnecessarily,
she will yell at me.

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.680
Hey, turn on the siren.

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:39.000
We may get into trouble.

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:40.640
Go.
- Okay.

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:53.600
Hey!

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:55.920
Turn it off. Switch off the siren.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.920
What can I do if she is resting?

01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.880
All I did was obey orders.
You go turn it off, please.

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:02.200
If the dean gets to know,
it will be a big issue.

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:04.760
You at least turn it off.
Sir, please tell them.

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:06.040
Can you hear me?

01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:08.240
Please go inside
and turn off the siren.

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.880
I beg you.

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:13.640
Turn it off. Sir, please.

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:17.160
I'll lose my job
if you trouble me like this.

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:19.040
I lost my job.

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:20.440
Hello, madam.

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:23.080
What is the problem?
- An ambulance is parked outside

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.880
I can hear a siren.
- They wanted to meet you.

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:28.720
Why are you twiddling your thumbs?
- I'll take care of it now, madam.

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:31.720
Tell them to come in.
- Sure, madam. Okay.

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:37.760
Turning up to jinx my job!
All because of my blessed fate!

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.760
Bloody! Go inside.

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.320
No help.

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:17.080
Enacting a drama!

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:34.320
If the gates aren't opened for you
will you turn on the siren?

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:38.400
Madam, we didn't know how else
to contact you, please pardon us.

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.400
I was briefed about you.
That's why I am talking to you.

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:44.920
None of the embalmers are in town.
Go now and come tomorrow.

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:47.000
It is possible if you
set your mind to it.

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:48.640
I'm also not feeling well.

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:51.040
Even if I sign, the embalmer
is not available.

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:52.320
Please leave.
- Madam.

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.560
Tell me what should be done.
I'll do it myself.

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.560
Do you know what embalming means?

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:03.840
We have to rip the stitches
from the post-mortem.

01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:06.640
Remove the intestines,
kidney and brain.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.440
Removed portions have to
be stuffed with cotton.

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:12.200
Make a hole in the thigh and

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:14.600
through nerves, pump
formalin chemical into the body.

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:16.240
Eyes will burn.

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:19.920
Finally have to restitch
the body perfectly like before.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.480
No flight will accept if there is
even the slightest mistake.

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:24.400
What? Are you willing to do that?

01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:28.400
No, madam.
- Come back tomorrow.

01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:34.760
What are you doing on a festive day,
without even eating?

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:36.520
Coming, mom.

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:42.280
One ticket has been booked already!

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:50.320
Where are we going now?

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:53.520
As if you won't tell me if you knew!

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.240
They are ganging up to make me mad.

01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:02.280
No one...

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.640
I know no one will help me.

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.880
I can't go back home.

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:08.920
This is hell.

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:13.720
Did I commit theft?
Did I do something wrong?

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:16.680
They are making me go mad using
the government as an excuse.

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.200
What did the government do?

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:21.560
What is the government doing
for the common man?

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:24.800
I can't take my wife
back in this birth!

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:26.720
What the hell!

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:29.200
Hey! Don't keep yelling
in an alien language!

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.360
Bad enough. We are
wondering where to go!

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.440
Asking me to sign here,
there, everywhere.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:40.560
Stop the vehicle. Stop.

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:44.240
Reverse the vehicle.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.480
Reverse, I say.

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:50.400
Stop now.

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:00.960
'It is the job of the Anatomy
department in medical college'

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:02.840
'to embalm the body.'

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:09.280
Why are you not
picking up the phone?

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.400
Very few tickets left.
Send the money soon.

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:13.040
Okay, I'll call you later.

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:18.640
Whom should I meet for embalming?
- Mohan, take him to Venkatesh sir.

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:24.000
Kanagu, what about the cash?
- Trying to arrange for the money.

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.240
Give me some more time.
- Please do it fast.

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:30.880
Hey.
- Okay.

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:39.720
Embalming can be done.

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:41.480
Pay twenty
five thousand rupees at the counter.

01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:42.560
The body can be embalmed.

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:44.160
Sir, I was told the
government centres

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:45.440
charge only a thousand rupees.

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:47.440
I don't have so much money.

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:50.000
If you don't have money,
it can't be done in private places.

01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:58.240
Sir.

01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:01.040
Dean asked if the staff was
available then it can be done.

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:04.200
If you have your staff,
can you send them?

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:07.720
It'll be very helpful.
They are out of town, sir.

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:09.040
Suresh.

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:13.560
Annammal Medical College,
Anatomy Department, madam.

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:19.320
Can you sign now, madam?

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:45.320
How long will embalm take?
- Ninety minutes.

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:46.880
Why are they insisting on embalming?

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:49.800
Other passengers on the flight
shouldn't get infected, right?

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:53.080
Grandma, serve generously.

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:55.920
I am the happiest to serve.

01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:57.520
Have your fill.

01:23:57.640 --> 01:23:58.960
Eat properly.
- Hello, who is this?

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:01.400
Sir, please bring
the coffin box immediately.

01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:04.280
Bro, don't you understand?

01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:06.720
I got a signature from Dean.
We are in medical college.

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:09.080
Bring the coffin and come soon, sir.

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:30.840
Tell me.

01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:33.200
Dude, I've transferred
20 thousand extra to your account.

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:34.200
Book another ticket.

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:36.840
Hey, I've also arranged for money.
Let's book all the tickets.

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:39.440
Super! Book for all three of them.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.200
Brother.

01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:49.880
Embalming. What is embalming?

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:54.840
Nothing. Removing
the stitches during post-mortem.

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:58.960
Kidney, intestines
should be removed.

01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:04.320
A chemical Formalin
should be pumped in.

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:10.200
The job will be over in an hour.
- Hey!

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:12.840
Are you all mad?

01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:15.120
Stop!

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:20.080
Hey...
- What happened?

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:22.200
Durai has arranged a cash
for buying the tickets.

01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:24.800
The coffin box is on the way.
- Super, brother.

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.640
So our problems are
getting solved one by one, right?

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:28.440
'No embalming!'

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:31.960
I've been watching all your drama.
I won't allow this.

01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:34.840
I won't allow any more of this.

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:37.680
'From this morning, you have...'
- Why is that man screaming?

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:38.800
Let go.

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:41.280
You can't embalm my wife. No!

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:44.160
What happened?
- He isn't allowing us to embalm.

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.840
Hey, what's your problem?

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:48.200
Only if all this is done,
you can go back.

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:51.640
Just ignore him. Let's wheel...
- Move aside!

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:53.800
Move!

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.560
Have you gone crazy?

01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:00.640
Don't you get what I'm saying?

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:04.520
Agreeing with the post-mortem,
I have committed a huge sin.

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:08.320
Why the hell can't you understand?

01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:11.880
You'll take the heart out,
take the intestines out.

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:14.520
And the kidneys, then the brain.

01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:17.520
How will I do the
last rites for her?

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.680
How will she go to heaven?

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:27.240
How will her soul rest in peace?

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:32.600
Which world are you living in?

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:36.080
Hey!

01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.440
Move.

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:38.800
Move aside.

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:40.320
Even if I die,

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:43.760
I will die, but I won't let
the embalming happen.

01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:48.840
Go and die!

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:52.560
Just die!

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:55.520
Fine, one to talk of peace!

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:59.160
You didn't let my mother
live in peace even for a day.

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:02.800
Now you are spinning a yarn about
heaven after she has passed away?

01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:04.200
Huh?

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:13.040
If you hadn't forced
the driver to speed up,

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:15.200
my mother would be alive today.

01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:17.360
She would be alive today.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.680
You murdered my mother.

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:26.080
You killed her. You!

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:31.360
These are strangers.

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:35.120
They have been helping us
the whole day. What did you do?

01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:39.480
As father and husband,
what did you do?

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:41.920
What have you done to date?

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:49.080
Enough.

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:50.520
Enough now!

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:52.280
Enough.

01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:55.360
Just shut up.

01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:57.680
If you want to sit, do so.

01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.160
Otherwise, get lost!

01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:05.400
I can take my brother
and mom back home, anyhow.

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.080
Get out!

01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:16.120
Please take her inside.

01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:44.440
Come. Let's go.

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:04.000
Mom.

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:06.840
Mom!

01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:10.320
Mom!

01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:13.160
Mom!

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:18.400
Mom!

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:20.440
Mom!

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:27.760
Mom!

01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:38.040
Can we seal it?

01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:40.160
Brother.

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:42.560
Let's go.

01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:47.640
Doctor, one minute.
- What happened?

01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:48.960
One minute, ask them not to seal it.

01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:50.800
I'll be back right away.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.040
Here.

01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:10.640
Holy water from Rameshwaram.

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:14.080
Holy water from Rameshwaram.

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:20.200
Water from Rameshwaram!

01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:22.600
Sprinkle on her.

01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:38.840
'If we bathe in the
Holy springs there,'

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.080
'he will become
a better person, dear.'

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:05.320
Take ten copies of this.

01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:07.000
You'll need it at the airport.

01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:09.120
Sir, I have to pay you...
- It's okay.

01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:17.680
Brother, do you believe in souls?

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.440
A person who is alive
may forget a good deed,

01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:24.920
but the soul will never forget.

01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:28.680
Just watch, this will change
your life beyond your imagination.

01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:31.200
From now on, only good news
will knock at your door!

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.080
Hello?
- 'Tickets not available.'

01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:43.320
'Sorry.'

01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:44.880
'I tried my level best.
I couldn't get it, though.'

01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:46.240
'What to do?'

01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:49.080
Okay, bring the cash to the airport.

01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:55.720
What is it?

01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:58.320
He couldn't get a ticket, it seems.

01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:01.600
Jinxed mouth!
On top of it, he smiles!

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:03.560
Let's go, brother.

01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:05.200
Come.
- Hey!

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:06.760
How do I break this news to them?

01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:09.040
'What to do? We have to tell them.'

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:10.200
Come,

01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:12.400
I'll take leave, sir.
- It's okay, take care.

01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:19.160
Sir.

01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:22.080
Tickets aren't available.

01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:24.800
Huh?
- No ticket.

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:27.680
Your daughter has a ticket.

01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:31.000
You and your son
didn't get the tickets.

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:40.760
Brother.

01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:45.480
It's getting late.

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:19.440
We can easily get them tickets
if they are going by bus or train.

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:22.360
We've never been to an airport.

01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:24.720
What do we do now?

01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:30.280
"Like a kite flying
with the cool wind."

01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:35.440
"Like a kite flying
with this cold wind."

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.800
"This life is like a kite flying
along with the cool wind."

01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:46.160
"Who can even tell
the direction it will blow?"

01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:51.440
"How can what I saw now
suddenly turn untrue somehow?"

01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:56.480
"Will I ever get back again
the soul that left me in pain?"

01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:01.960
"We came all the way to see God.
Instead, we lost our Goddess today."

01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:06.920
"Is our life just a
hide-and-seek game every time?"

01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:12.440
"Am I the only witness
on this earth in total distress?"

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:17.360
"This life is like a kite flying
along with the cool wind."

01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:22.880
"Who can even tell or know
the direction it will blow."

01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:59.840
"I did not realise your value, dear
when you were by my side here."

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.120
"Now that I do,
you are nowhere, dear."

01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:07.800
"Like a boat all alone in the sea."

01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:10.320
"My life is lost and lonely."

01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:15.560
"No punishment in this world
can redeem my actions multifold."

01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:20.800
"Even if a flower
blooms in water daily"

01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:24.320
"its fragrance mixes
only in the air duly."

01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:26.040
"How strange fate can be!"

01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:31.240
"This heart wilts in sadness
in love, lost and unexpressed."

01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:36.480
"Eyes well up with tears forlorn."

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:41.800
"Even a flower blooms in a stone."

01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:46.880
Sonu!

01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:49.000
Sonu, what happened?

01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:50.800
Sonu. - Sonu, open your eyes.
What happened to you?

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:52.080
What is it?
- Sonu.

01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:54.400
Brother. - Stop the vehicle.
- Brother, stop.

01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:55.960
Stop.

01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:58.680
Sonu. Give me a hand.

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:00.240
Look at him.

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:02.920
What happened?
- Get some water, brother.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.080
What happened?

01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:07.640
Brother.
- Sonu.

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:18.600
What is it?

01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:27.200
"Red ants queue up to carry
a grain of rice in harmony"

01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:32.320
"marching to their
home in solidarity."

01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:35.080
"Truth be told in reality."

01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:42.800
"I did not take care of my family.
Not even like this tiny red ant."

01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:48.040
"Even if I set out on a pilgrimage
as a good deed in my middle age."

01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:53.240
"Can I atone for my sins ever
in this world, I wonder?"

01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:58.440
"Only today, for better or worse
I see my face and my true colours."

01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:03.640
"Eyes well up with tears forlorn."

01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:08.400
"Even a stone hearted
person is changed in time."

01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:13.320
"This life is like a kite flying
along with the cool wind."

01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:18.600
"Who can even tell or know
the direction it will blow."

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:23.880
"How can what I saw now
suddenly turn untrue somehow?"

01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:28.920
"Will I ever get back again
the soul that left me in pain?"

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:34.440
"We came all the way to see a God.
Instead, we lost our Goddess today."

01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:39.360
"Is our life a
just a hide-and-seek game?"

01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:45.440
"Am I the only witness
on this earth in distress?"

01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:59.240
Where's the certificate?
- In the ambulance.

01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:02.960
What, brother?
- He's coming.

01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:19.320
Why is there
a spelling mistake, sir?

01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:23.560
See this.

01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:27.320
Her name has been typed 'Janki'
in the First Information Report.

01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:29.840
In the death certificate
it is 'Janaki'.

01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:32.400
So what, sir?
- How can you be so flippant?

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:35.120
We are concerned about even
the smallest of spelling mistakes.

01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:37.120
Different name
means different person.

01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:38.800
It means you have
hidden a dead person

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:41.120
and bought some other corpse here.

01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:44.000
Are you serious, sir?
I asked you this morning.

01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:46.440
You said if we miss this flight,
the next flight is four days later.

01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:49.240
I agree. I did, but what can I do
about this spelling mistake?

01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:52.400
Get me a proper certificate.
- We are running short of time, sir.

01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:55.720
Air India will maintain
this record for five years.

01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:58.280
We have to face the repercussions
if there's any mistake.

01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:00.640
It's getting late.
Go and rectify it.

01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:02.320
Sir.

01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:03.800
Sir.

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:09.280
What happened?

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:10.720
They won't allow it.
- Why it seems?

01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:12.360
This document has
a spelling mistake.

01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:15.320
Give it.
- Hey!

01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:16.320
Come.
- Wait.

01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:19.320
All this has to go to Lucknow.
- Are you playing the fool?

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:22.720
We sweated it out from the morning
and got everything ready.

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:25.440
You ask us to come tomorrow
so coolly. - Get out of this room.

01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:26.640
Why should we go?

01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:28.400
We won't go until
we send them back home.

01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:30.680
If a person from
another state dies here.

01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:33.360
Red-tapism rules the roost,
it's alright.

01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:35.320
But shouldn't
you consider our plight

01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:36.680
having got everything ready, sir?

01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:38.440
You make trouble
for those who are alive

01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:40.040
and you don't spare
the dead, either.

01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:42.160
How will a spelling mistake
affect the dead woman?

01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:43.720
What is the problem?

01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:45.680
In their certificate...
- Sir.

01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:46.920
One minute, please step out

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.920
and look at the bereaved
family, then speak, sir.

01:42:58.720 --> 01:42:59.880
Come, sir.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:01.640
This is the daughter.

01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:06.640
Give me the paper.
- Here.

01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:17.600
Did you do this in one day?
- Yes, sir.

01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:26.360
Submit a declaration
and you can take the deceased home.

01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:28.680
Thank you, sir.
- Okay, thank you.

01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:32.120
Will you show your
sincerity to them?

01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:33.000
Sorry, sir.

01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:44.520
Okay, go home.
- Let me also stay.

01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:47.040
It was so good of you to have gone
out of your way on Deepavali.

01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:48.920
Go home.
- Okay.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.440
Let's go.
- Yes, Brother.

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:52.000
Where's your bike, brother?

01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:53.960
Who will lend money
on a festival day?

01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:55.800
I didn't know what to do.

01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:57.840
I sold my bike.

01:43:58.400 --> 01:43:59.520
How could you do that?

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:02.080
Don't feel bad.
Nothing compared to this.

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.880
I can handle it. See you.

01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:06.280
Let's go.

01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:17.000
'The flight to Ahemadabad,'

01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:19.240
'Gate number one from Chennai.'

01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:21.480
'May I have your kind attention,
please, ladies and gentlemen.'

01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:23.040
'This is the security call for all

01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:24.880
passengers travelling
on SpiceJet flight.'

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.200
SG 611.

01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:29.520
'Dad!'

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:33.480
You'll be fine, dear.

01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:40.520
I won't leave you and go.
- Don't be sad.

01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:22.040
Sorry, sir. Tickets
are not available.

01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:24.240
Please wait.

01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:26.800
Madam, somehow...
- Flight is fully booked, sir.

01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:28.320
Passengers are waiting, sir.

01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:29.680
Please listen to me.
- No, ma'am.

01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:32.360
No chance of getting two seats.
Please co-operate, sir.

01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:33.680
Next.

01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:39.800
I couldn't get tickets for them.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.400
What do you mean?

01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:43.280
No ticket.

01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:45.680
'May I have your kind attention,
please? Ladies and gentlemen.'

01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:48.840
'Air India flight AI 4208 to Delhi'
- Hey, give it.

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:51.480
'is now ready for departure.'
- Have this.

01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:53.640
You have to take
a connecting flight.

01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:56.360
Safe travel.

01:45:57.440 --> 01:45:59.600
I'll somehow send them soon.

01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:05.560
Do you understand what I'm saying?

01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:01.760
B... B...

01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:03.960
Brother.

01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:05.760
Please.

01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:10.080
My Shiv.

01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:17.720
Alone.

01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:19.800
No.

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:35.800
Bro.
- Let go.

01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:47.640
'May I have your attention, please,
ladies and gentlemen.'

01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:51.960
'This is the call for the
flight 6E 7198 from Chennai.'

01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:54.120

ladies and gentlemen.'

01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:56.840
'This is the security call for

01:47:56.920 --> 01:48:00.160
'Spicejet SG 611 to Chennai.'

01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:59.360
Sir, boarding has
already been announced.

01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:02.440
No Air India staff member is flying
either to give up their seats.

01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:03.800
What can I do, sir?

01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:07.240
We don't know anything
about Airport rules.

01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:09.480
It took time for us to
get the death certificate.

01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:11.720
Sir, this flight
is only up to Lucknow.

01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:14.440
To reach Ayothi, she has to
travel another 135 km, sir.

01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:16.720
How can she shift
her dead mother's body all alone?

01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:28.120
I am flouting rules. Listen to me.

01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:30.520
This is the passenger list.

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:36.000
If two passengers
give up their seats.

01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:37.640
You are lucky.

01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:42.080
I can't do anything more.
- Thank you, sir.

01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:47.320
'Attention passengers of
Air India flight 4208 to Delhi.'

01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:49.760
'Due to an emergency,
a family is seeking your help'

01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:51.120
'to travel to Delhi'

01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:53.440
'If any two passengers
is kind enough to'

01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:55.720
'withdraw your tickets
and help the family.'

01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:02.200
Hello, excuse me for one minute.

01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:06.800
Sir wants to talk to you.
Please listen to him.

01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:17.360
This travel must be important in
some way or the other to all of you.

01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:22.040
But she has lost a dear one.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.360
Unknown city. Unfamiliar language.

01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:29.360
Every single minute, she is here.

01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:31.600
She must be yearning to
go back to her home town.

01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:34.120
And cry for her departed mother
in her mother tongue.

01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:35.760
This is natural.

01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:41.120
If just two of you can give up
your ticket for them.

01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:43.400
It will be a lifetime
favour for them.

01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:48.360
Please.

01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:50.200
Please help them.

01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:52.840
Please. Just two tickets.

01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:03.560
I have enquired everywhere
Their problem is genuine.

01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:05.400
And your help will be appreciated.

01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:14.560
No chance, sir.
- Appeal once again.

01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:17.320
We've done our best, sir.
What more can we do?

01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:38.280
My dear son.

01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:47.880
We are going to visit our grandson.
It's our first flight experience.

01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:50.440
But that's alright.

01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:53.200
You take our seats.
We'll go some other day.

01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:08.800
Brother?
- They got tickets.

01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:10.800
Brother.
- They got tickets to fly!

01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:12.920
Bring them here, quick.
- Okay.

01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:15.400
Hey! Hindi! You got your tickets.

01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:19.200
Your ticket is confirmed.

01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:21.160
Confirmed?
- Come.

01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:23.040
Come, my dear boy.

01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:37.120
Sister.

01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:40.480
Sonu!

01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:56.480
'May I have your kind attention,
please? Ladies and gentlemen.'

01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:59.400
'Indigo announces the
arrival of its flight, 6E.'

01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:06.920
How did you come here?

01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:26.320
Brother.

01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:35.560
What is your name?

01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:40.200
Abdul Malik!

01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:07.000
"When good people get together
good deeds accumulate forever."

01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:12.160
"Every town and city will be
a garden of love certainly."

01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:14.560
"Whatever one's religion may be,"

01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:17.440
"whichever direction
we travel daily."

01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:19.600
"When the language of love connects"

01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:22.600
"everything changes
to shower a success."

01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:27.720
"Life teaches all of us for sure via
ups and downs, pain and pleasure."

01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:31.200
"Faith is the key. If you
believe anything might change."

01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:33.040
"Oh, mind,
hold on to faith night and day."

01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:38.280
"Faith will unite you and me
in our life in solidarity."

01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:47.960
"Love is the bridge that will
connect to make our lives perfect."

01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:49.640
Brother.

01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:52.600
We will return to Rameshwaram.

01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:54.440
I don't know if it
will be a pilgrimage.

01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:58.120
But I'll come to see
my brother, Abdul Malik.

01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:04.400
Thank you.

01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:10.600
"Our lullaby for you."

01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:13.720
"Our minds and hearts bloomed anew"

01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:16.200
"with help from
strangers we never knew."

01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:21.400
"Abdul Malik or
Sitaraman may be the name."

01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:23.280
"It is the same."

01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:26.360
"Love is the key
to peace and unity."

01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:28.920
"When hearts bloom in love-shower"

01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:31.920
"where do Gods and
religions feature?"

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:36.760
"In every heart will flow
love as a spring, you know."

01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:42.360
"Tears are the true essence
of love in every sense"

01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:01.600
'Good evening, passengers.'

01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:04.040
'This is your Captain Anburaj,

01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:07.560
'We are happy to welcome
you on board...'

01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:43.480

My mother has passed away.
I don't have money to cremate her.

I'll do it for you. Come.
